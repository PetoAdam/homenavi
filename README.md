# Homenavi

**A smart home platform for developers, by developers. Modern, microservice-based, and built to be extended.**

Welcome to Homenavi ‚Äì your open, hackable smart home solution. Built with a modern microservices architecture, Homenavi is designed for tinkerers, makers, and pros who want full control and easy extensibility.

## üß© Architecture

Homenavi is built as a set of loosely coupled microservices:
- **Frontend:** Modern React SPA, served by Nginx.
- **API Gateway:** Central entrypoint, JWT auth, request routing.
- **Auth Service:** Handles authentication, issues JWTs.
- **User Service:** Manages user data and validation.

All services communicate via HTTP/REST. Add your own services and plug them into the gateway!

## üê≥ Quickstart (Recommended)

The fastest way to get Homenavi running is with Docker Compose. Just clone, configure, and launch:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PetoAdam/homenavi.git
cd homenavi
cp .env.example .env  # Edit as needed
# Then:
docker compose up --build
```

- All services will be built and started automatically.
- Edit `.env` for secrets and service URLs.
- See [`/doc/local_build.md`](doc/local_build.md) for advanced/local development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Extending Homenavi

Want to add a new service? Just drop it in, add to `docker-compose.yml`, and go! The API Gateway makes integration easy.

- Use Go, Python, Node.js, or any language you like.
- Register new routes in the API Gateway.
- Share authentication via JWT.
- Check out the [Extending Guide](doc/extending.md) (coming soon!)

---

## üì¶ CI/CD

- All services are built and tested via GitHub Actions on every push/PR.
- Docker images are saved as artifacts for easy deployment.
- Workflows for each service live in `.github/workflows/`.
- Add your own workflow for new services!
