# Example installed integrations config.
#
# Copy this to installed.yaml (or keep it elsewhere and point
# INTEGRATIONS_CONFIG_FILE at it) and list your running integrations.

# Example integration item (uncomment to use):
# integrations:
#   - id: hello-homenavi
#     upstream: http://hello-homenavi:8099
#
# Note: inside Docker Compose you can omit host port mappings entirely.
# The proxy should point at the container port (default 8099).
